# Manipulate CP2K Cube Files

The `CP2KData` Python package provides tools for working with cube files generated by the CP2K quantum chemistry software. One of the standout features of this package is its ability to handle CP2K cube files and perform various analyses.

## Getting Started
Import the necessary modules and load a cube file:
```python
from cp2kdata import Cp2kCube
cube_file_path = "slab-ELECTRON_DENSITY-1_0.cube"
mycube = Cp2kCube(cube_file_path)
```

## Retrieving Cell Information
Users can easily obtain cell information from CP2K cube files by the following method
```python
cell = mycube.get_cell()
type(cell)
```
As a result, you will get new object `Cp2kCell`
```shell
# output
cp2kdata.cell.Cp2kCell
```

## Retrieving Structural Information
CP2K cube files include structural information, making it easy to work with atomic structures. You can retrieve this information using the `get_stc()` method:

```python
stc = mycube.get_stc()
```
The stc is ASE `Atoms` object
```shell
#output
ase.atoms.Atoms
```

## Integration over space
User can obtain the integration over space using the `get_integration()` method, for example, if you get integration using density cube, you will get the total number electrons in this cube
```python
mycube.get_integration()
```
```shell
#output
1152.0007910850024
```
The result is not exactly an integer. User should round it to integer manually.

## Planar Averaging
You can calculate planar average data from the cube file, both with and without interpolation:
```python
# Get planar average data without interpolation
pav_x, pav = mycube.get_pav(axis="z", interpolate=False)

# Get planar average data with interpolation (4096 interpolation points)
pav_x, pav = mycube.get_pav(axis="z", interpolate=True)
```

## Macro Averaging
The `get_mav()` method allows you to compute macro average data with or without interpolation. Specify the length of the first and second periodicity (l1 and l2) and the system type (ncov) as parameters:

```python
# Get macro average data without interpolation
mav_x, mav = mycube.get_mav(l1=4.8, l2=4.8, ncov=1, interpolate=False)

# Get macro average data with interpolation
mav_x, mav = mycube.get_mav(l1=4.8, l2=4.8, ncov=2, interpolate=True)

```

## Addition and Subtraction of Cp2kCube
The Cp2kCube class provides a convenient way to perform addition and subtraction operations on CP2K cube files, allowing you to manipulate the data contained within them. This method is extremly useful, if you would like to obtain the charge difference
```python
from cp2kcube import Cp2kCube

# Load the first cube file
cube1 = Cp2kCube("path/to/cube1.cube")

# Load the second cube file
cube2 = Cp2kCube("path/to/cube2.cube")
```
```python
# Perform addition of two Cp2kCube objects, the values of two cubes are added
result_cube = cube1 + cube2

# Perform subtraction of two Cp2kCube objects, the values of two cubes are subtract
result_cube = cube1 - cube2

```
The resulted object is a new Cp2kCube, with which, all above methods can be used.

## Writing Cube
The Cp2kCube can write data into a cube file with cp2k format using the `write_cube()` method:
```python
mycube.write_cube("./test.cube")
```
With this command, you will obtain a new cube file under the current folder.

## Quick Plotting
Easily create quick plots of your data with the quick_plot() method. The method returns matplotlib `figure` object, with which, users can further manupulate the figure or save it to a directory.
```python
fig = mycube.quick_plot(axis="z", interpolate=False)
fig.savefig("pav.png")
```

## View Planar and Macro average in Terminal
CP2K are often installed in HPC, which means no graphic interface but only the terminal for users. `CP2KData` uses command line tools to check Planar and Macro average in terminal

In your terminal, type
```shell
cp2kdata cube view --cube_file slab-ELECTRON_DENSITY-1_0.cube
```
You will get
![terminal_plot](./terminal.png)
The width of plot can be adjusted according to your terminal width
```shell
cp2kdata cube view --cube_file slab-ELECTRON_DENSITY-1_0.cube --width 80
```
For other option, see the help
```
cp2kdata cube view --help
```
```shell
Usage: cp2kdata cube view [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --cube_file TEXT  cube file
  --axis TEXT       axis
  --mav BOOLEAN     switch on macro average or not
  --l1 FLOAT        l1
  --l2 FLOAT        l2
  --ncov INTEGER    ncov
  --unit TEXT       unit
  --width INTEGER   width
  --help            Show this message and exit.
```


## Benchmark Comparison
The Planar Average and Macro Average results from cp2kdata are benchmarked against those from Siesta and Abinit, as shown in the following figures:

![mav_plot](./MAV_compare.png)

Note: The Planar Average and Macro Average results in this package are benchmarked against [Siesta and Abinit](https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/reference/macroave.html).
